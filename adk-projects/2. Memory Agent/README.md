### âœ… What You Got Right:

1. **`session_service` is the true source of session truth**:
   It holds the full state of the session, identified by `app_name`, `user_id`, and `session_id`.

   - This includes:

     - User messages (Content)
     - Agent responses
     - Tool call logs
     - Internal thoughts/events
     - Error/escalation data
     - Session metadata

2. **`Runner` updates this central session state**:
   When you call `runner.run_async(...)`, it:

   - Pulls the session from `session_service`
   - Updates it as the conversation unfolds
   - Pushes all changes back into `session_service`

3. **`session_stateful` is a snapshot**:
   When you do:

   ```python
   session_stateful = session_service.create_session(...)
   ```

   you're getting a **reference to the current state** of the session. But that reference:

   - Might become outdated if the session is updated elsewhere
   - Does **not auto-sync** unless the object is mutated in-place and shared

4. **You need to explicitly fetch the updated session again**
   via:

   ```python
   updated_session = session_service.get_session(...)
   ```

   to get the **latest** post-run version.

### ðŸ§  Refined Analogy:

- `session_service` = **Live Google Doc**
- `session_stateful` = **Downloaded Word copy (or maybe a shortcut to the Doc)**

If others are editing the Google Doc (i.e., the runner/agent), your downloaded file wonâ€™t reflect the changes unless you go fetch a fresh copy.

---

### âœ… Final Note:

The session object you initially received may sometimes **point to the same object** (especially in `InMemorySessionService`), so **minor changes _might_ reflect** â€” but **you should never rely on this behavior**. Always `get_session()` again when you need consistency.
