### **Session_service vs Memory_service**

- `session_service` is used to store and manage the **ongoing conversation (short-term memory)** for a single session.
- `memory_service` is designed to store **long-term knowledge** by persisting information **across sessions** (selectively).

---

#### **What defines a session?**

A session is uniquely identified by this triplet:

- `app_name`
- `user_id`
- `session_id` ← acts like a chat ID (e.g., "morning_chat")

Example:

```python
session_service.create_session(
    app_name="MealAssistant",
    user_id="adi123",
    session_id="morning_chat"
)
```

#### **How context flows in a session**

If you say:

```text
[User]: Hi, my name is Ahaskar. What do you do?
```

And the agent replies:

```text
[Agent]: I help with ADK-related queries.
```

Then on the next turn:

```text
[User]: What is my name?
```

The LLM receives:

```text
[User]: Hi, my name is Ahaskar. What do you do?
[Agent]: I help with ADK-related queries.
[User]: What is my name?
```

Because this session’s context is stored in `session_service`.

---

#### **Key Insight**

- Asking questions **within the same session** works because all previous messages are kept in memory and passed to the model.
- Once you start a **new session**, that context is lost — unless you’ve manually stored relevant facts in `memory_service`.

---

#### **Rule of Thumb**

> Use `memory_service` to retain **important information** across sessions.
> `session_service` is best viewed as **temporary working memory** within one chat.

---

#### 🛠️ **Use `load_memory` tool** to search `memory_service` inside agents that need historical context.

| Step | Function Called           | Purpose                                   |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ✅   | `add_session_to_memory()` | Store a session’s key info for future use |
| 🔍   | `search_memory()`         | Retrieve relevant past info via a query   |

### 🔄 So what's the difference Between `load_memory` and `search_memory()`?

Both `load_memory` and `search_memory()` ultimately do the **same job** —  
they **retrieve relevant information from the `memory_service`** using a search query.

The difference lies in **who uses them** and **how**:

| Aspect                           | `search_memory()`                   | `load_memory` (tool)                       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Who uses it?                     | **You (developer)** manually        | **The LLM agent** automatically            |
| How is it used?                  | Called directly like a function     | Called by agent as a tool                  |
| When is it triggered?            | When **you** write logic to call it | When the agent **reasons** it needs memory |
| Return type                      | `SearchMemoryResponse`              | Tool `FunctionResponse` passed to agent    |
| Integrated with agent reasoning? | ❌ No                               | ✅ Yes                                     |
| Tool-like                        | ❌ No                               | ✅ Yes                                     |

### ✅ Examples

#### `search_memory` (manual developer-side call):

```python
response = memory_service.search_memory("my_app", "user1", "project alpha")
for result in response.results:
    print(result.event.content.parts[0].text)
```

#### `load_memory` (agent-side tool usage):

```python
agent = LlmAgent(
    name="MemoryAgent",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction="Use the load_memory tool if you need past info.",
    tools=[load_memory]
)
```

> ✅ **Summary**:
> Both retrieve memory from `memory_service`, but `load_memory` is designed for use by the agent within its reasoning flow, while `search_memory()` is a direct function you call manually in your own logic.
