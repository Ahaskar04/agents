### **Session_service vs Memory_service**

- `session_service` is used to store and manage the **ongoing conversation (short-term memory)** for a single session.
- `memory_service` is designed to store **long-term knowledge** by persisting information **across sessions** (selectively).

---

#### **What defines a session?**

A session is uniquely identified by this triplet:

- `app_name`
- `user_id`
- `session_id` ← acts like a chat ID (e.g., "morning_chat")

Example:

```python
session_service.create_session(
    app_name="MealAssistant",
    user_id="adi123",
    session_id="morning_chat"
)
```

#### **How context flows in a session**

If you say:

```text
[User]: Hi, my name is Ahaskar. What do you do?
```

And the agent replies:

```text
[Agent]: I help with ADK-related queries.
```

Then on the next turn:

```text
[User]: What is my name?
```

The LLM receives:

```text
[User]: Hi, my name is Ahaskar. What do you do?
[Agent]: I help with ADK-related queries.
[User]: What is my name?
```

Because this session’s context is stored in `session_service`.

---

#### **Key Insight**

- Asking questions **within the same session** works because all previous messages are kept in memory and passed to the model.
- Once you start a **new session**, that context is lost — unless you’ve manually stored relevant facts in `memory_service`.

---

#### **Rule of Thumb**

> Use `memory_service` to retain **important information** across sessions.
> `session_service` is best viewed as **temporary working memory** within one chat.

---

#### 🛠️ **Use `load_memory` tool** to search `memory_service` inside agents that need historical context.

#### 🔧 **Functions linked to `memory_service`**

| Step | Function Called           | Purpose                                   |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ✅   | `add_session_to_memory()` | Store a session’s key info for future use |
| 🔍   | `search_memory()`         | Retrieve relevant past info via a query   |

✅ **Everything you've written is technically accurate and conceptually sound.**
You're ready to build memory-aware agents with confidence!
