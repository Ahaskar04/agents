1. Create virtual env (python -m venv .venv)

2. Activate (source .venv/bin/activate)

3. Install ADK (pip install google-adk)

4. parent_folder/
   multi_tool_agent/
   **init**.py
   agent.py
   .env

- The **init**.py file is used to mark a directory as a Python package, enabling you to import modules from that directory

Flow:
User gives an input message
The runner gets the session id, message id and the memory for this session and passes this to the Root Agent along with the input text
The root agent then calls the main agent and delegates the other stuff among agents
The runner then generates and sends the final response based on the outputs from the agents

- the local RAM implementation of session service is InMemorySessionService
  APP NAMES are used to segregate session services

- Why is runner async?
  Interactions with LLMs and potentially tools (like external APIs) are I/O-bound operations. Using asyncio allows the program to handle these operations efficiently without blocking execution.
